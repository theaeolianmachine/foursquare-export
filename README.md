# Foursquare Export

A series of scripts and tools for exporting data from Foursquare.

* `fs_api.py` — Tooling for interacting with the Foursquare API.
* `fs_list_data.py` — Tooling for pulling list data down from Foursquare's API.
* `fs_migrate_to_new_lists` — Tooling for taking existing favorites in lists and migrating them to
  a new list structure (much faster than doing yourself in the UI).
* `oauth_service.py` — Tooling for getting an OAuth token from Foursquare and storing it locally in
  a JSON file.
